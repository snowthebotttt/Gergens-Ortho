## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the platform built by the creators of Next.js and offers the easiest deployment experience.

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
3. Run the following command from the project directory:
   ```
   vercel
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to deploy your project

### Option 2: Traditional Hosting

1. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
2. The build output will be in the `.next` directory
3. Upload the following to your hosting provider:
   - `.next` directory
   - `public` directory
   - `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files
   - `next.config.js` file
4. Install dependencies on the server:
   ```
   npm install --production
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. If you need to add API keys or other configuration in the future, create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your variables.

## Customization

### Updating Content

- Page content can be modified in the corresponding files in the `src/app` directory
- Components can be found in the `src/components` directory
- Styles are defined in `src/app/globals.css` and through Tailwind utility classes

### Changing Colors

The color scheme is defined in:
- `tailwind.config.js` - for Tailwind utility classes
- `src/app/globals.css` - for CSS variables

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new file in the appropriate directory under `src/app`
2. Use the existing pages as templates
3. Update the navigation in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` if needed

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

1. Some ESLint warnings about unescaped entities and HTML links
2. The 3D product viewer mentioned in the requirements has not been implemented
3. The RSS integration from ASBA.net for the blog section needs to be implemented
4. The virtual lab tour feature needs to be implemented
